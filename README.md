# chromium-taskstation
Chromium Taskstation / Kiosk for Ubuntu Server 20.04

This is a debian package that turns an Ubuntu Server installation into a single-purpose machine auto-running Chromium. It does not include any desktop environment, rather, it adds the bare minimum to run Chromium full screen:

* X11 Server
* Ratpoison -  a minimalist window manager
